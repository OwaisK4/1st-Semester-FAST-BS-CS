<center><p style="font-family:'Lucida Console'">My name is Muhammad Ahmed, aged 19 years old. I am currently studying at <a href="http://khi.nu.edu.pk/">FAST-NUCES</a>, Karachi. This is my webpage, which I developed for my ICT assignment. My intro will be brief as there is not much to say :P My favourite sport is football, which I love to watch more than playing. Favourite team is <a href="https://www.manutd.com">Manchester United</a> as you can judge by my social profile picture. I study Computer Science at Bachelors level, and want to pursue same field throughout my life. Programming is not my speciality but I love to learn new things. My aim is to be productive and enjoy life at the same time. I believe personal interest in a professional field is better than being forced to study it, as dreams can only be achieved by self confidence and you can not have it unless there is a creative spark, which comes with interest.<br>Thank You for bearing with me, and good day to you!</center></p>
