<center><p style="font-family:'Lucida Console'; font-size:22px">My name is Owais Ali Khan. I am 18 years old and currently enrolled at <a href="http://khi.nu.edu.pk/">FAST-NUCES Karachi</a>. I have been fascinated by computers from a very young age, and have spent a lot of time tinkering with whatever software I could get my hands on and wrap my head around.
I mainly studied computer science on my own time, as I have always had a bias against the formal and rigid way of teaching found in most classrooms. My aim in studying computer science is to become a cybersecurity expert. I set this goal after being inspired by the life story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Edward Snowden</a>. My other hobbies include reading books, playing videogames, and watching movies.
Although I'm not really an optimistic person, I have high hopes of acheiving great things and obtaining success in my chosen field. That concludes my introduction. Thank you.</center></p>
